I'm Ot√°vio, a Physicist and Software Engineer from Brazil living abroad for almost 10 years. I build software for macOS and iOS, after years working with Linux and Embedded Systems.

I'm addicted to coffee, games, cats, science, [pencils](https://blackwing602.com/), and [pocket notebooks](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/).
