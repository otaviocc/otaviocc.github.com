## 🔭 Working

I recently resigned from my position at [GetYourGuide](http://www.getyourguide.com/), where I was helping future travelers finding and planning safe and incredible travel experiences. I'm excited to start on my new job, where I'll develop for macOS, focusing in privacy and security.

## 🌱 Hacking

I’m currently exploring SwiftUI and Combine. As part of my  experiments I built [Pinboarding](https://github.com/otaviocc/Pinboarding), a [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) client for macOS.

## 📚 Reading

I'm currently reading (again) [REMOTE: Office Not Required](https://basecamp.com/books/remote) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson.

## ✏️ Writing

I'm currently working on a blog post about Unit Tests and Test Doubles.

## 🎧 Listening

I'm currently listening to [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org), [Twenty Thousand Hertz](https://www.20k.org), and [Freakonomics Radio](https://freakonomics.com/archive/).

## 🎮 Gaming

I’m currently playing [Octopath Traveler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler), [Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%2B_Rabbids_Kingdom_Battle), and, eventually [Dragon Quest Builders 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_Builders_2).
