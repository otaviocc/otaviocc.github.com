The way OLED displays control brightness is using PWM (*Pulse Width Modulation*), which means lower-lit images are an illusion. They’re actually achieved using short bursts of bright light. In other words, the image is constantly flickering.

If you do have problems with flickering lights and images as I do, I would recommend you to modify your iPhone settings to “Reduce White Point”, which adds a dark layer on top of the image on the iPhone screen, making it darker. With this setting you can use the iPhone with max. brightness, reducing the flickering.

Go to *Settings > Accessibility > Display and Text > Reduce White Point*. I use mine at 80%.
