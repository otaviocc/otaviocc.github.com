> Born in 1936, Marshall grew up in the Fillmore District of San Francisco. At an early age, he fell in love with music and cameras and began photographing with a box camera. He was a fixture in San Francisco’s North Beach coffeehouses and soon was photographing resident musicians throughout the city with a Leica rangefinder. Jim’s big break came after a chance run in with John Coltrane and afterwards went on to shoot jazz greats such as Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, among others.  After spending two years in New York to become established, he returned to San Francisco for good and began shooting for Rolling Stone and Time Magazine.

If you're in San Francisco, love music and photography, you cannot miss the exhibition [The Photography of Jim Marshall][the-exhibition] at the local Leica Store. There will be an opening reception on Thursday, August 6, 2015 from 6pm-8pm. Leica Store also sells the book with Marshall's work, [The Haight: Love, Rock, and Revolution][the-haight], for $50, but Amazon sells it for about half the price.

Just an example of what you will find there:

* A youthful Bob Dylan rolling a tire down a New York City street,
* The Beatles’ last live concert at Candlestick Park,
* Johnny Cash flipping his middle finger to the San Quentin Prison warden,
* Jimi Hendrix lighting his guitar on fire during his performance at Monterey Pop Festival.

Don't miss it.
